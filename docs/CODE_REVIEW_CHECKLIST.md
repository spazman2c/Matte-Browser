## Review Guidelines

1. **Be constructive**: Provide specific, actionable feedback
2. **Focus on the code**: Avoid personal criticism
3. **Consider context**: Understand the broader impact of changes
4. **Ask questions**: Clarify unclear code or decisions
5. **Suggest alternatives**: Offer better approaches when possible
6. **Be thorough**: Don't skip sections of the checklist
7. **Follow up**: Ensure feedback is addressed

## Review Roles

- **Primary Reviewer**: Deep technical review, architecture validation
- **Security Reviewer**: Security-focused review (for security-sensitive changes)
- **Performance Reviewer**: Performance impact assessment (for performance-critical changes)
- **Documentation Reviewer**: Documentation quality and completeness
- **Final Approver**: Overall sign-off and merge decision

This checklist should be used for all code reviews to ensure consistent quality standards across the Matte Browser project.
